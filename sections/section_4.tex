\subsection{Deep Reinforcement Learning: Policy Gradient Method}

\subsection{Simulation Environment and Libraries}

The Policy Gradient algorithm was implemented in Python language using the TensorFlow library, which is an open-source library for artificial intelligence and machine learning.

To carry out the simulations, the MuJoCo software was used (Multi-Joint Dynamics with Contact), a simulator for multi-body dynamics with contact. The computational model used to implement the algorithm was a two-dimensional bipedal robot Walker2d-v2, which has 7 joints and two translational movements (horizontal and vertical). During the simulation, the model went through 40 million states to assess how gait evolved as the Policy Gradient algorithm was implemented.

All simulations were carried out on a computer with Intel\textregistered Core\texttrademark i7-8750H 2.20 GHz processor, 8.00 GB of RAM, 128 MB dedicated video card, Windows 10 Home Single Language 64 bits. The Python version XXX and the MuJoCo XXX were the platforms where the simulations took place.
